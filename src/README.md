# Introduction

## About this Course

Welcome! I am **Julien Dauliac**, a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), formerly known as **DevOps**. I have a background in **software architecture** and enjoy **development** in general. My favorite technologies include **Nix** and **Rust**, and I take a strong stance in advocating for efficient and modern software practices.

You can find my **GitHub** here: [https://github.com/Dauliac](https://github.com/Dauliac)

My courses are structured but adaptable. I frequently adjust the content based on my mood, **your questions**, and the interests of the group. If a topic excites you, feel free to askâ€”I am happy to form smaller breakout groups to dive deeper.

I am opinionated and **proselytizing** about good software practices.

All course materials are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/Dauliac/Cours](https://github.com/Dauliac/Cours)

My CV is also available here: [https://github.com/Dauliac/resume](https://github.com/Dauliac/resume)
