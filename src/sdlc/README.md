## Definitions

### Software Delivery Life Cycle

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process that enables the production of high-quality software at the lowest cost within the shortest time frame.

In French: Cycle de d√©veloppement logiciel

### Framework

- Agile
- DevOps

### CI

Continuous Integration (CI) involves regularly and automatically integrating developers' source code into a shared repository. Each code modification triggers automated tests to detect errors as early as possible.

- Test automation
- Supply chain automation
- Code review automation

### Supply Chain

Code used to build software

- [`Taskfile`](https://taskfile.dev)
- [`nix`](https://nixos.org/)
- `cmake`/`make`

### CD

In Continuous Delivery, versions are ready to be deployed but aren't deployed automatically.

- Automation of delivery
- Automation of deployment

### A picture is worth a thousand words:

## 5W

| What | CI/CD is an approach for automating software development processes. |
| --- | --- |
| Who | It involves developers, testers, and automated tools. |
| Where | It can be used in any development environment. |
| When | It's applied throughout the development cycle. |
| How | It automates compilation, testing, deployment, and feedback management. |
| Why | It aims to improve quality, accelerate development, reduce errors, foster collaboration, and enable frequent deployments. |

## Also

- Automate labor: `#DEVOPS` üåª
- Achieve economies of scale ü™ú
- Reduce stress üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Entities

- Culture: DevOps
- Agile management: Release train
- Code: Software Development Life Cycle
- Platform:
  - Software forge (GitLab or others)
  - CD Platform
- Craftsmanship: `Humans + Tools = ü§ü`

# DEVOPS üíì CICD

- A deeply DevOps practice
- Automate labor: #DEVOPS üåª
- Collective management of non-functional aspects
- Test everything that can be tested

## Non-functional aspects

- A specification: RFC ISO 25 010
- ISQTB

## Keys performance indicators (KPI)

- Managers don‚Äôt always know what's best for non-functional aspects.
- An alternative to non-factual directives.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è KPI can become a tool for team pressure:
  Data isn't facts, and facts aren't goals.

### My Favorite KPI üîë

- Automation factor
- Technical debt
- Code coverage
- CVE rate
- Automated test failure rate

### DORA Metrics

1. Deployment frequency
1. Change execution delay
1. Mean time to recovery
1. Change failure rate

# CI/CD Architecture üèóÔ∏è

## CI/CD Geography üó∫Ô∏è

- Local to your development machine (on Linux or other OS)
- Software forge: GitLab and others‚Ä¶
- External tools: SonarQube, Argo-CD,

### 4 Steps

![height:400px](./assets/sdlc-mermaid-4-steps.svg)

______________________________________________________________________

1. Linting:
   The linting phase ensures that the codebase is in good shape. This may include checking formatting, style, and auto generated code.

______________________________________________________________________

2. Building:
   Builds should adhere to these properties:
   - idempotence
   - efficiency
   - speed

______________________________________________________________________

3. Deployment:
   - **[Push vs Pull Workflows](https://std.divnix.com/patterns/ci-cd-10000-feet.html#push-vs-pull-workflows):**

     | Tool | Method | Description |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | `ansible` | ‚¨áÔ∏è | Code and operations are sent to production from a client machine using SSH. |
     | `fluxCD` | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è | The `fluxCD` server listens to your software forge to pull updates. |

______________________________________________________________________

4. **[Probing & Attestation Phase](https://std.divnix.com/patterns/ci-cd-10000-feet.html#probing--attestation-phase):**

- Remote runner VS Inplace runner

## Monorepo vs Polyrepo

- The organization of repositories is a crucial aspect of CI/CD.
- Splitting or not splitting projects will determine the ease of adopting tools and practices‚Ä¶

### Polyrepo

- **Advantages:**
  1. Isolation and independence between projects.
  1. Easier management of individual repositories.
  1. Improved performance and scalability, but more complex maintenance.
- **Disadvantages:**
  1. Harder project coordination.
  1. Risk of inconsistency and divergence.
  1. Tedious maintenance with multiple repositories.

### Monorepo

- **Advantages:**
  1. Easier collaboration and code sharing.
  1. Centralized version and security management.
  1. Possibility of frequent merge conflicts and complex dependencies.
- **Disadvantages:**
  1. Frequent merge conflicts.
  1. Errors in one project can impact the entire system.
  1. More complex management as it scales.

### How to split?

- [Team topology](https://teamtopologies.com/)
  - Projects should mirror teams:
    - If CI/CD is a shared responsibility ‚û°Ô∏è  Monorepo
    - If each team has its own DevOps *(developers or SRE, OPS)* ‚û°Ô∏è  Polyrepo

### And for CI/CD

- Monorepo for CI/CD:
